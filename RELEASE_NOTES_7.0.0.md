# √Åsbr√∫ Connection Manager 7.0.0 - Modernization Release

## üéâ Major Modernization Release

Version 7.0.0 represents a comprehensive modernization of √Åsbr√∫ Connection Manager, bringing it into compatibility with modern Linux distributions while maintaining full backward compatibility with existing configurations and workflows.

## üö® Important Notice

**This is a fork of the original asbru-cm/asbru-cm project**

The original √Åsbr√∫ Connection Manager project (https://github.com/asbru-cm/asbru-cm) has not been actively maintained since 2022 and fails to run on modern Linux distributions due to outdated dependencies. This modernization fork addresses these issues while preserving all original functionality.

## üéØ Target Platforms

- **PopOS 24.04** with Cosmic desktop environment
- **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** with GNOME/Wayland
- **Fedora 40+** with GNOME/Wayland

### Secondary Support
- Other modern Linux distributions with GTK4 support
- X11 display server (fallback compatibility)

## üîÑ Breaking Changes from 6.4.1

### System Requirements
- **GTK4 Required**: GTK3 is no longer supported
- **Modern Perl**: Requires Perl 5.32+ with updated modules
- **Display Server**: Optimized for Wayland, X11 supported as fallback

### Compatibility Layer
```perl
# New PACCompat module provides seamless migration
use PACCompat;

# Automatic GTK version detection and adaptation
my $window = PACCompat::create_window();
my $box = PACCompat::create_box('vertical', 5);
```

### Display Server Detection
```perl
# Automatic environment detection
my $display_server = detect_display_server();  # 'wayland' or 'x11'
my $desktop_env = get_desktop_environment();   # 'cosmic', 'gnome', etc.
```

## üì¶ Installation and Migration

### Fresh Installation

#### PopOS 24.04
```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libgtk-4-1 libadwaita-1-0 gir1.2-gtk-4.0

# Install √Åsbr√∫ CM 7.0.0
# [Package installation commands will be provided with final release]
```

#### Ubuntu 24.04
```bash
# Enable universe repository if needed
sudo add-apt-repository universe

# Install GTK4 dependencies
sudo apt install libgtk-4-1 libadwaita-1-0 gir1.2-gtk-4.0 gir1.2-vte-3.0

# Install √Åsbr√∫ CM 7.0.0
# [Package installation commands will be provided with final release]
```

### Migration from 6.x

#### Automatic Migration
1. **Configuration**: Existing `~/.config/asbru/` settings automatically migrated
2. **Connections**: All connection profiles preserved with enhanced security
3. **Passwords**: Encrypted passwords re-encrypted with modern algorithms
4. **Preferences**: UI preferences adapted to GTK4 equivalents

#### Manual Steps
1. **Backup**: Create backup of `~/.config/asbru/` before upgrade
2. **Dependencies**: Ensure GTK4 libraries are installed
3. **Testing**: Verify all connections work after migration
4. **Cleanup**: Remove old GTK3 packages if desired

## üß™ Testing and Validation

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **GUI Tests**: Automated widget rendering and interaction testing
- **Protocol Tests**: SSH, RDP, VNC, and serial connection validation
- **Performance Tests**: Startup time and memory usage benchmarking
- **Integration Tests**: Desktop environment and system integration

### Platform Testing
- **Primary**: Extensive testing on PopOS 24.04 with Cosmic
- **Secondary**: Validation on Ubuntu 24.04 and Fedora 40+
- **Compatibility**: X11 fallback testing on various distributions

## üêõ Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Limitations
- **System Tray**: Traditional system tray not available in Cosmic (by design)
- **Legacy Themes**: Some GTK3-specific themes may not work
- **Older Distributions**: Requires manual GTK4 installation on older systems

### Workarounds
- **System Tray**: Use application menu or create desktop shortcuts
- **Themes**: Use GTK4-compatible themes or system default
- **Older Systems**: Consider using original 6.4.1 version or upgrade OS

## üîÆ Future Development
