# Task 4 Implementation Summary: Fix Connection Tree Dark Theme Support

## Overview
Successfully implemented theme-aware TreeView styling and automatic theme change detection for the Ásbrú Connection Manager connection trees.

## Completed Subtasks

### 4.1 Implement theme-aware TreeView styling ✅
- **Created `_applyTreeTheme` function** in `lib/PACCompat.pm`
  - Uses PACCompat::CssProvider for cross-GTK compatibility
  - Generates dynamic CSS based on current theme (dark/light)
  - Applies proper contrast colors for tree view text and background
  - Handles both GTK3 and GTK4 compatibility

- **Implemented `_generateTreeCSS` function**
  - Dark theme: White text (#ffffff) on dark background (#2d2d2d)
  - Light theme: Black text (#000000) on white background (#ffffff)
  - Proper selection colors with blue highlight (#4a90d9)
  - Hover states for better user interaction

- **Added helper functions**
  - `applyTreeThemeToWidgets()` - Apply theme to multiple widgets
  - CSS provider management and cleanup

### 4.2 Add automatic theme change detection ✅
- **Enhanced theme monitoring system**
  - `registerTreeWidgetForThemeUpdates()` - Register widgets for auto-updates
  - `unregisterTreeWidgetFromThemeUpdates()` - Clean unregistration
  - `startTreeThemeMonitoring()` - Initialize theme change monitoring

- **GTK signal connections**
  - Monitors `notify::gtk-theme-name` signal
  - Monitors `notify::gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme` signal
  - Monitors `notify::gtk-icon-theme-name` signal
  - Automatic theme cache invalidation on changes

- **Widget management**
  - Tracks registered tree widgets
  - Automatic cleanup of invalid widget references
  - Statistics and monitoring capabilities

## Integration Points

### PACMain.pm Integration
- Applied theme styling to all tree widgets:
  - `treeConnections` (main connection tree)
  - `treeFavourites` (favourites tree)
  - `treeHistory` (history tree)
  - `treeClusters` (clusters tree)
- Started theme monitoring after GUI initialization

### PACCompat.pm Enhancements
- Added 6 new exported functions for tree theme management
- Enhanced existing theme detection and caching system
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code

## Testing

- Widget reference management
- Signal connection cleanup on shutdown
- Cache invalidation on theme changes

## Requirements Satisfied
- **3.1**: Enhanced theme detection system ✅
- **3.2**: Improved theme caching and monitoring ✅
- **3.3**: Automatic theme change detection ✅
- **3.4**: TreeView styling implementation ✅
- **3.5**: Cross-GTK version compatibility ✅

## Files Modified
1. `lib/PACCompat.pm` - Added tree theme functions and monitoring
2. `lib/PACMain.pm` - Integrated theme application for all tree widgets
3. `t/gui/test_tree_theme_integration.pl` - Created integration test

## Benefits
- **Improved accessibility** with proper contrast colors
- **Automatic theme adaptation** without application restart
- **Consistent user experience** across different system themes
- **Cross-platform compatibility** with GTK3/GTK4 support
- **Performance optimized** with caching and efficient CSS application

The implementation successfully addresses the dark theme support issues in connection trees while maintaining compatibility and providing a robust foundation for future theme-related enhancements.
