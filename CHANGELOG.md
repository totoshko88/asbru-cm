- ‚úÖ Wayland display server
- ‚úÖ GTK3 environments

## modern41 - 2025-08-17
### Added
- CLI flag `--force-icon-rescan` and env `ASBRU_FORCE_ICON_RESCAN=1` to force internal icon theme directory rescan.
- Env `ASBRU_DEBUG_STACK=1` gates expensive debug stack traces (separates from generic ASBRU_DEBUG).

### Changed
- Version bump to modern41.
- PACIcons duplicate theme scan guard now honors force flag/env.

### Notes
Stack traces for duplicate scans now emitted only when ASBRU_DEBUG_STACK=1 (reduces noise/perf impact).

## modern40 - 2025-08-17
### Added
- Functional system icon theme selection: selecting 'system' under Icons Theme now allows specifying a GTK icon theme name which is applied via Gtk3::IconTheme::set_custom_theme on startup.
- Persists chosen system icon theme in config key 'system icon theme override'.
- Environment variable ASBRU_ICON_THEME still overrides for quick testing.
- Graceful fallback to internal assets if theme load fails.
- Dynamic internal theme discovery & dropdown population (no hardcoded list).
- Force internal icons toggle with guarded preference widget insertion.
- Icon scanning optimization: single scan per theme directory with duplicate-scan guard & debug counters.
- Internal/system theme application guards preventing redundant reapplication.
- Debug stack traces (ASBRU_DEBUG=1) for duplicate theme apply attempts & icon rescans.

### Changed
- Consolidated theming logic and added early exit paths for performance.
- Updated packaging scripts to produce version 7.0.0+modern40 artifacts.

### Fixed
- Prevented duplicate GTK widget packing warnings in Preferences dialog.
- Resolved missing variable declaration issues during build (e.g. $btn_prev scope).
- Eliminated redundant icon directory rescans reducing startup overhead.

### Packaging / Distribution
- Debian package build verified; install/run validated under system paths.
- Added .gitignore rules to exclude build outputs & transient artifacts from VCS.

### Notes
Debug instrumentation remains enabled; will be pruned or conditioned in a subsequent maintenance release if performance impact is observed in wider testing.
